# Isomorphic Riot
An attempt for an isomorphic appliction using RiotJS 2. Includes:
+ ES6 code base using Babel transpiler and Browserify. **With ES7 async/await**
(_SystemJS example available in the 'systemjs' branch_)
+ Shared routing code between client and server using [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) and [Page.JS-Express-Mapper](https://github.com/kethinov/page.js-express-mapper.js).
+ Riot rendering on the server side using riot.render() and a custom template engine.
+ Server services powered by [Feathers.js](http://feathersjs.com/) with Realtime WebSocket communication using Primus.
+ User authentication using [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/)
+ Flux architecture with help of [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl/) - Also used for routing logic.
+ *waitBeforeRendering* - waits for events to occur before rendering the main tag
+ ES6 riot tag files without using the *.tag extension.
+ Support for Autoprefixer - Gulp tasks extract css from javascript tags, concatinate them and run postprocessing.
+ Gulp based tasks for running the node app using [gulp-live-server].
